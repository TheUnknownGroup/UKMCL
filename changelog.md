## Information
This is the first version, it is still currently in the works but since it is experimental, anyone is allowed to test this and give feedback, which is deeply appreciated.

## Changes and Fixes
Since there are no other versions, there are no changes, but what it does is allows the user to click a button, and input text.

## Incoming additions
There will be some definitive changes to the GUI the next time there is a release.
